Visualize Web Data of Earthquakes using Leaflet

### Dataset:
USGS Earthquake Data: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

## Objectives
### Step 1 - D3 Import
- Use the D3 library to read in all_week.geojson from the URL
### Step 2 - Leaflet Visualization
- Utilize Leaflet to visualize an USGS earthquake dataset
  - Create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude
- Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color
  - Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color

- Popups provide additional information about the earthquake including the location, magnitude, depth and time when its associated marker is clicked
